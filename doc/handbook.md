Work in progress

#### Pseudo-spectral code for DNS of Homogenous isotropic turbulence.
#### Tentative HANDBOOK

# Parallelization strategy 
- SPLIT = 0

- SPLIT = 1

# Structure of the source code:
- m_* identify a module file.
- input.f90, simulation parameters 


# Arrays 
- wrk(:,:,:,:) contains the velocity and the scalar fields.
- The last index identifies the velocity components, 1-streamwise (x), 2-spanwise (y), 3-"wall-normal" (z), 4 and so on are used for the scalars.

Pseudo-spectral code for DNS of Homogenous isotropic turbulence.
Base code is hit3d rearranged and modified.
Currently working on the following machines:
-OS X (MacBook Pro)

Things to be done/updated (ASAP)
-Particles tracking (input, output files, remove cint? only trilinear?)
-Particles output for paraview, reading of the output is fine but files are not generated.
-Compile.sh (automatic setup of input.f90 file)

To run a simulation:
A) Setup the input.f90 file.
B) execute ./compile.sh
